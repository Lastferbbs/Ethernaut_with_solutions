In older version of solidity (up to 0.4.21) consturctor was defined as a function with the same name as a contract
Since version 0.4.22 constructor keyword exists.
Problem with this level is that contract name is Fallout and the function name is Fal1out - if u call the function Fal1out u become contract owner.
